To run the test suite(single core) you can either type "make tests" in amolqc main folder or type "./tests.sh"
   in "run" folder.
./tests.sh PARALLEL     performs  parallel tests
./tests.sh GEN          generates reference files for single core calculations
./tests.sh PARALLELGEN  generates reference files for calculations with two cores


How to add a new test to the tests suite:

For a new test you need a new folder in "run" directory contains a script named "RUN".
"RUN" can be written in any scripting language but make sure that you have the runtime environment
everywhere. For your script you may consider these points.

1- It should be possible to generate reference file(if it is necessary) using "GEN"  environment variable.
2- Reference files should be saved with .$REF extension this helps to keep ref file for both parallel and non parallel 
   calculations.
3- You can use input template file also wave function to avoid unnecessary repeated files but it is not mandatory.
4- in case of failure "FAILED=1" environment variable should be exported and a warning should be printed(red color code font)
   is preferred.
You can look at run/01_sample folder as an example.
